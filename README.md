# Python-challenge
In this challenge I created two python scripts to analyze financial records (PyBank) and to modernize vote-counting process (PyPoll)

In the PyBank file I have calculated the below - 
 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In the PyPoll file I have compiled the following 
 - The total number of votes cast. 
 - A complete list of candidates who received votes
 - The percentage of votes each candidate won
 - The total number of votes each candidate won
 - The winner of the election based on popular vote

I used the concepts learned in class as well as got help from my Tutor.
